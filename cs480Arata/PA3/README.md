### Notes

Sometimes when building and running my file, it will incorrectly launch. The only fix is to close the window and restart the program. Sometimes this has to be done several times, you will know its working correctly because rotational spinning of planet and moon will be good.


A - Changes axis rotation of Planet
Left Click- Changes rotation of Planet
D - Changes axis rotation for Moon
F - Changes rotation of Moon




### CMake Instructions
The building of the project is done using CMake, installation with apt-get or brew may be necessary. Later use with CMake and Shader files will be require the copy of a directory where those files are stored (ex. shaders). To do this in the ```add_custom_target``` function place 
```cmake
COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/shaders/ ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/shaders
```

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./Tutorial
```

### Makefile Instructions 
The makefile works as expected and must be updated with new files added in.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cp ../makefile .
make
./Tutorial
```

## Ubuntu.cse.unr.edu
OpenGL 3.3 will run on the [ubuntu.cse.unr.edu](https://ubuntu.cse.unr.edu/) website. To do so follow the build instructions, but when running the Tutorial executable use this line to execute.
```bash
/usr/NX/scripts/vgl/vglrun ./Tutorial
```
