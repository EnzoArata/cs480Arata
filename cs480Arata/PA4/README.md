### User Input and Object Loading

```bash
An openbox and the Dragon are already stored in my files
In order to load a certain object, type in the whole file name
Examples "openBox.obj" , "dragon.obj"
```


```bash
Too load other objects simply cope the .obj file
then paste it into the Objects folder located in build
```




### Keyboard Input

Sometimes when building and running my file, it will incorrectly launch. The only fix is to close the window and restart the program. Sometimes this has to be done several times, you will know its working correctly because rotational spinning of planet and moon will be good.

```bash
A - Changes axis rotation of Planet
Left Click- Changes rotation of Planet
D - Changes axis rotation for Moon
F - Changes rotation of Moon
```



### CMake Instructions
Open Terminal Inside the build folder
